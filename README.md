## Hailey Bates Code Refractor
This is the code refractor homework for UCF bootcamp, week 1!
On this repo, I have a few items that were cleaned up for the client per the requests. This is the first project in class that I worked on, so be gentle when reviewing. This repo had some challenges, but with some sweat and tears, we managed.
